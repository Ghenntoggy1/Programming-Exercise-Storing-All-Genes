PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Storing All Genes"
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of StorageResources in order to store all genes found in a DNA strand.
                    Advanced work with StorageResource and String type of variables.
                    Part 1 - Parse DNA strands into all genes found inside of this strand.
                    Part 2 - Calculate the CG Ration of DNA strand and count the appearences
                    of "CGA" codon in a DNA strand.
                    Part 3 - Open multiple or one file that contain a string of DNA strand
                    and program will find all genes in this DNA strand and store them into
                    ResourceStorage and count them, after that it will output all genes 
                    larger than 60 chars and count them,will calculate CG Ratio of all of 
                    them and output those with ratio greater then 0.35 and count them, will 
                    calculate the longest gene from all stored and will count the appearences
                    of "CTG" codon in the DNA sample.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej".
                           Find inside of this project 3 classes: Part 1 - compile, 
                           create object of type Part1 and start function "testGetAll";
                           Part 2 - compile, create object of type Part2 and start
                           function "test"; Part 3 - compile, create object of type Part3
                           and start function "testProcessGenes".
